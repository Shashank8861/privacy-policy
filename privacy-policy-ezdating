 Effective date: February 12, 2026
 
 This Privacy Policy explains how EZ Dating ("EZ Dating", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, shares, and protects information when you use the EZ Dating mobile application (the "App") and related services. By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this policy.
 
 If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the App.
 
 ## Who We Are
 EZ Dating is a dating service. We help people create profiles, match, and communicate with other users. The App is intended for adults only.
 
 ## Information We Collect
 We collect information in the following categories:
 
 ### 1. Information You Provide
 - Account information: email address, name, age, city.
 - Profile information: bio, interests, relationship intent, gender, interested-in preferences, and other profile details such as salary, height, diet, drinking and smoking preferences (optional).
 - Photos and media: profile photos and any images you send in messages.
 - Verification information: photo of government ID and a selfie for profile verification.
 - Messages and interactions: chat messages, gifts sent and received, likes, passes, super likes, matches.
 - Support requests: information you include in emails to support, feedback, or bug reporting.
 - Gift card redemption requests: your email address, requested gift card value, and related redemption details.
 
 ### 2. Information We Collect Automatically
 - Usage data: app activity such as swipes, matches, messages, and feature usage.
 - Device information: device identifiers, device model, operating system, app version, language, and IP address.
 - Analytics data: events and usage patterns collected through Firebase Analytics.
 - Log data: basic diagnostic information needed to operate and secure the App.
 
 ### 3. Location Information
 - Precise or approximate location (latitude and longitude) to show nearby matches and calculate distance.
 - You can control location permissions through your device settings.
 
 ### 4. Payment Information
 - In-app purchases are processed through the app store (Google Play or Apple). We receive transaction identifiers, purchase dates, and subscription or product status from the store, not your full payment card details.
 
 ## How We Use Information
 We use information to:
 - Create and manage your account and profile.
 - Provide matching, search, and discovery features.
 - Enable messaging and gift interactions.
 - Process subscriptions, purchases, and gift card redemptions.
 - Verify profiles and reduce fraud.
 - Improve and personalize the App experience.
 - Provide customer support and respond to your requests.
 - Send notifications (match, message, marketing if enabled in settings).
 - Enforce our Terms of Service and protect users.
 
 ## Legal Bases for Processing (Where Applicable)
 Depending on your location, we rely on the following legal bases:
 - Contract: to provide the App and its features.
 - Consent: for optional features like marketing notifications and location access.
 - Legitimate interests: to improve the App, ensure safety, and prevent fraud.
 - Legal obligations: where required by law.
 
 ## How We Share Information
 We may share information:
 - **With other users**: your profile information, photos, and messages are visible to matched users and people you interact with based on your settings.
 - **With service providers**: trusted vendors who provide infrastructure and services, such as Firebase/Google Cloud, analytics providers, and cloud storage.
 - **With payment platforms**: app store providers to process in-app purchases and subscriptions.
 - **With legal authorities**: if required by law, regulation, legal process, or to protect rights and safety.
 - **In business transfers**: if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.
 
 We do not sell your personal information.
 
 ## Your Privacy Controls
 The App includes settings that allow you to:
 - Enable or disable marketing notifications.
 - Control visibility of online status and distance.
 - Use incognito mode to limit profile visibility.
 - Update or delete your profile information.
 - Delete your account at any time.
 
 ## Data Retention
 We keep information as long as needed to provide the App, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. If you delete your account, we delete or de-identify your data except where we must keep certain records for legal or security reasons.
 
 ## Account Deletion
 You can delete your account in the App. Account deletion removes your profile, photos, verification media, matches, messages, gifts, and other associated data from our systems, subject to legal retention requirements.
 
 ## Security
 We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your information. No system is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
 
 ## International Transfers
 Your information may be processed in countries other than your own, including in the United States and other regions where our service providers operate. We take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers where required.
 
 ## Children’s Privacy
 The App is intended for adults and is not directed to individuals under 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 18. If you believe a minor is using the App, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.
 
 ## Third-Party Services and Links
 The App uses third-party services such as Firebase (authentication, database, storage, analytics), Google Sign-In, and app store billing services. These providers have their own privacy policies that govern their processing of your data.
 
 ## Changes to This Policy
 We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy in the App or on our website and update the effective date. Your continued use of the App after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
