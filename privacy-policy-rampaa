Privacy Policy
Effective date: 25 Feb 2026
This Privacy Policy describes how Rampaa ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application (the "App").
By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

1. Information We Collect

1.1 Information You Provide Directly
Depending on the features you use, we may collect:
Contact information: such as your email address if you contact us for support or feedback.
Other information: any information you choose to provide when communicating with us.
We do not require you to create an account or provide personal information just to download or use the basic features of the App.

1.2 Automatically Collected Information
When you use the App, certain information may be collected automatically, including:
Device information: device model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, language, and country.
Usage data: in-app pages visited, game sessions, gameplay statistics, features used, and other interaction data.
Log data: IP address, app version, timestamps, crash reports, and diagnostic data.
This information is typically collected in an anonymized or aggregated form and does not directly identify you.

2. Use of Information
We use the information we collect for purposes such as:
Providing and improving the App: ensuring the App functions correctly and improving performance and gameplay.
Analytics: understanding how users interact with the App so we can improve features and user experience.
Support and communication: responding to your questions, feedback, or support requests.
Security and fraud prevention: protecting the App and our users from abuse and misuse.

3. Third‑Party Services
The App may use third‑party services that collect, monitor, and analyze information to help us provide and improve the App. These services may have access to some of your information as described in their own privacy policies.
Examples of such services may include (depending on your build and configuration):
Google Play Services
Google AdMob (for advertisements)
Google Analytics for Firebase / Firebase Analytics
Firebase Crashlytics (for crash reporting)
We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third parties:

If you do not wish to share data with these services, you may limit data collection by adjusting your device or operating system settings where available (for example, resetting your advertising ID or using "Limit Ad Tracking" / "Opt out of Ads Personalization").

4. Advertising
If the App displays ads:
Ad networks may use cookies, mobile identifiers, and similar technologies to show ads they believe may be more relevant to you based on your activity within the App and other apps.
This may involve interest‑based advertising or personalized ads, depending on your settings and applicable law in your region.
You can usually opt out or limit personalized ads by:
Adjusting ad settings on your device (e.g., "Opt out of Ads Personalization" on Android).
Using privacy settings provided by the ad network, where available.

5. Children’s Privacy
The App is not intended for children under the age of 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under this age.
If you believe that a child under the applicable age has provided us with personal information, please contact us using the details below and we will take steps to delete such information.

6. Data Retention
We retain information only for as long as necessary to:
Provide and improve the App.
Comply with our legal obligations.
Resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
When information is no longer needed, we will delete it or anonymize it.

7. Data Security
We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, including:
Access: to request a copy of the information we hold about you.
Correction: to request that inaccurate or incomplete information be corrected.

Adjust privacy and permission settings on your device (e.g., access to storage, notifications).
Limit or reset your advertising ID in the device settings.

9. International Transfers
Your information may be transferred to and processed on servers located outside your country or region, where data protection laws may differ. By using the App, you consent to such transfers, subject to applicable law.
